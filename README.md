# This is my attempt at a BullShit programming language

This is going to be a small attempt at a little project called B#
It uses the extension .bs (for B# 100%)

# Goals for this programming language?
My goals at the moment are just to enable it to perform very general programming concepts like math, variables, print functions if/else statements
loops etc. etc.
